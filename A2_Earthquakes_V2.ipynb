    "The effect of an earthquake on a city or person will depend on their distance from the source of the quake. The effect of an earthquake will depend on many factors and even the dependence on distance to source is very complex. However, after a bit of background research, Brandon has come up with a simple formula which hopefully at least gives a very crude estimate of relative effect of a quake with a particular magnitude and depth on a surface location at a known surface distance from the quake's epicenter. The calculated effective magnitude of an earthquake will be less that the source magnitude, for instance a magnitude 9 quake at a depth of 100km (which is likely to be extremely destructive, would have an effective magnitude of 5 at its epicentre (directly above the source) and 3.585 at a point on the earth surface 500km away from the epicenter."

For example, calculating `epicenter_magnitude` enables weaker earthquakes to be ignifed withought the need to determine their distance from every city on earth. It may also be useful to not that when calcuating the effective magnitude of a given quake (with a specific depth) at different locations, the value always decreases as surface distance from the quake increases. \n",
